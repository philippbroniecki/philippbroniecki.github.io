	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p style="text-align:justify">I am a political scientist (postdoctoral fellow/assistant professor) in the <a href="https://www.sv.uio.no/isv/english/">Department of Political Science</a> at University of Oslo. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at the ESRC Business and Local Government Data Research Centre at University of Essex. I hold a PhD from University College London and an MA from the University of Mannheim.</a></p> 
	<p style="text-align:justify">I research legislative politics and institutions with a focus on the European Union. My interests include political negotiations, strategic behaviour and the consequences of rising Euroscepticism. Currently, I work on the <a href="https://www.sv.uio.no/isv/english/research/projects/StREP/index.html">Strategy of Recorded Voting in the European Parliament (StREP)</a> project which 1) automatically collects and updates individual-level voting data as well as contextual information from the European Parliament; 2) makes the data available to the wider community; 3) develops an estimator of preferences from voting behaviour that takes the strategic aspect of roll-call voting into account; 4) analyses new developments of voting behaviour in the EU.
	<p style="text-align:justify">Methodologically, I focus on machine learning and I also apply methods for causal inference with observational data in my research. I am a developer and maintainer of the statistical software package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=autoMrP">autoMrP</a> for the R language which applies machine learning techniques to better estimate subnational public opinion from surveys. Furthermore, I participate in a Cambridge University Press book project on "Multilevel Regression and Poststrati: A Practical Guide and New Developments" where my contribution is a chapter on regularized regression.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">I have instructed members of local government institutions such as law enforcement as well as university undergraduates and postgraduates in R, Python, introductory and advanced statistics, programming and data science. Furthermore, I advice local government institutions, human rights/civil liberties NGOs and civil society charities on research methodology and public policy.</p>

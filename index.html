	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<p style="text-align:justify">I am a political scientist and Senior Research Officer (research fellow) at the <a href="https://www.blgdataresearch.org/">ESRC Business and Local Government Data Research Centre</a> at University of Essex.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">I research legislative politics/legislative institutions with a focus on the European Union. My interests include political negotiations such as the infamous early agreement system in the European Union and its consequences on representation and political power. My work also relates to the determinants of bargaining failure, the consequences of increased politicization of EU politics, and improving measurement methods for concepts such as policy influence and support for integration.
	<p style="text-align:justify">Methodologically, I have a strong focus on causal inference with observational data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to improve forecasting precision and consequently policy output. Currently, I participate in a project on using machine learning techniques to better estimate subnational public opinion. Furthermore, I take part in an effort that applies quantitative text analysis to leverage data from open-ended survey questions collected by development organisations, in a project on forecasting conflict escalation from big data, and an analysis of peace agreement texts to identify common strategies of mediators, their success, and determinants of the negotiation agenda.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">As part of the mission of the ESRC Business and Local Government Data Research Centre, I instruct members of local government institutions such as law enforcement in R, Python, introductory and advanced statistics. Furthermore, I have experience teaching quantitative methods at undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate levels and I advice human rights/civil liberties NGOs on research methodology.</p>
